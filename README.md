# Implement EventStore

In this challenge I decided not to use java libraries as ArrayList. So I
built my own eventList, in order to dinamically store data in the eventList 
and have a better efficiency in memory allocation I used a linked list structure 
and an auxiliar class called EventNode that
helps me with the linked list.
  
  More details in the code comments.
